Molecular-Drug-Likeness-Visualization
This repository contains a Python script to visualize drug-likeness evaluations of molecules using an alluvial (Sankey) diagram. The visualization helps in understanding the classification of molecules based on multiple drug-likeness criteria.
Features:
Sankey Diagram Representation: Displays molecule classifications across Lipinski, Pfizer, GSK, and Golden Triangle rules.
Interactive Plotly Visualization: Provides an intuitive, interactive graphical representation.
Customizable Data: Easily adaptable to different datasets for drug evaluation studies.
Requirements:
pandas
plotly
Usage:
Run the script to generate an interactive Sankey diagram for molecular drug-likeness assessment.
